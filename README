# Step 1
- Add or replace respective main.cpp/main.hpp file in the root of the project.
- the engine won't compile without it.

# Compile
- to compile run 'make'
- to remove object files run 'make clean'

# Client Server
- To start the server run './main server'
- To start a client run './main client'

Note that main.cpp allows only 3 clients right now (since we don't randomize a new client position and select from an existing list)

# P2P
- add peers by running './main pp'

Again only 3 peers will be able to run due to the above mentioned reason.
